How to define such a T may of course depend on the problem at hand, but we will give below a generic strategy. First, we give sufficient conditions, that we can explicitly try to check in practice, allowing to prove that an operator T is contracting on a small neighborhood of \\bar x . Even though we only deal with finite dimentional problems in this first part of the tutorial, we already state these conditions in a general Banach space, as they will also be heavily used in the remainder of the tutorial. \"\"\" Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"tip\", \"Theorem\", md\"\"\" Let X be a Banach space, \\bar x \\in X , and T X\\to X a continously differentiable map.

Of course, we are then only allowed to consider r\\in 0,r^ . In practice, studying carefully how \\Vert DT x depends on \\Vert x \\bar x \\Vert allows us to get better bounds. However, we can sometimes get away with crude estimates. That is, we derive a constant Z^ such that \\Vert DT x \\Vert \\leq Z^ for all x in X such that \\Vert x \\bar x \\Vert \\leq r^ , and then use Z s Z^ for all s\\leq r^ . The conditions on r then simplify, and, if Z^ 1 , we can take any r\\geq \\frac Y 1 Z^ . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Going back to a dynamical system x n 1 f x n , a natural fixed point operator for period 3 orbits is given by T x f^3 x , i.e. f composed with itself three times. However, such a T has no reason to be contracting near a period 3 orbit. In order to get a general procedure to construct a fixed point problem, one can start by finding a map F such that solutions of our problem are isolated zeros of F . Then, given an approximate solution \\bar x , one can consider the Newton like fixed point operator T x x DF \\bar x ^ 1 F x , which should be contracting on a neighborhood of \\bar x , as DT \\bar x 0 . For finite dimensional problems of moderate size , the inverse of DF \\bar x is mostly innocous, but DF \\bar x ^ 1 may become very hard to deal with for infinite dimensional problems. Therefore, one often considers instead an approximate inverse A\\approx DF \\bar x ^ 1 and the fixed point operator T x x AF x . We state all following results in this context, for an A which is not specified and could actually but does not have to be DF \\bar x ^ 1 . \"\"\" Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"tip\", \"Corollary\", md\"\"\" Let X and Y be two Banach spaces, \\bar x \\in X , F X\\to Y a continously differentiable map, A Y\\to X an injective linear map, and r^ 0 .

Many slight variations can be found in the literature, and are used in many many CAPs see for instance ^BL15 ^NPW19 and the references therein . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Interval arithmetic \"\"\" md\"\"\" When we want to use the Newton Kantorovich theorem with \\bar x being an approximate solution obtained using the computer, we also need to use the computer to evaluate quantities like \\Vert F \\bar x \\Vert and get the required bounds Y and Z . However, by default the computer will evaluate \\Vert F \\bar x \\Vert using floating point arithmetic, and the output will contain rounding errors. In particular, if we set Y \\Vert F \\bar x \\Vert on the computer, we in fact do not know whether Y actually satifies the assumption of the Newton Kantorovich theorem or not. Interval arithmetic gives us a way to control rounding errors and to get guaranteed results from the computer. We only give a brief description of interval arithmetic here, and refer to ^Moo79 ^Tuc11 for more comprehensive treatments. \"\"\" md\"\"\" When a command like `a 0.1` is executed, the computer associates to the variable `a` a single floating point number the floating point number which is the closest to the real number 0.1 . However, because 0.1 does not have a finite representation in base 2, 0.1 is not a floating point number, so the value stored in `a` is already not equal to 0.1 . It turns out to be slightly larger than 0.1 , but it could very well have been the other way around. \"\"\" a 0.1 a 1 10 md\"\"\" When using interval arithmetic, we can instead represent any real number by an interval, whose end points are floating point numbers. That is, the computer can also represent `a` as an interval \\underline a ,\\overline a , whose end points should be floating point numbers satisfying \\underline a \\leq a \\leq \\overline a . We give up the hope of representing numbers exactly, but we recover guaranteed information the real number a is contained in the interval representing it on the computer. \"\"\" ia I\"0.1\" interval 1 interval 10 in interval 1 10,ia md\"\"\" The rules of interval arithmetic then ensure that this property is preserved when doing arithmetic operations. For instance, consider two intervals `a` and `b` of the form \\underline a ,\\overline a and \\underline b ,\\overline b , containing the reals numbers a and b . When we do `c a b`, the resulting interval \\underline c ,\\overline c for `c` is computed as follows. For \\underline c , we take \\underline a \\underline b rounded downward a sum of two floating points numbers is not necessarily a floating point number , and for \\overline c we take \\overline a \\overline b rounded upward . In particular, the real number c a b is contained in the interval `c`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Similarly, if the variable `c` is an interval \\underline c ,\\overline c , and we do `d exp c `, we would like to get for `d` an interval containing \\ \\exp c ,\\ d\\in \\underline d ,\\overline d \\ . Usual arithmetic operations, as well as implementations of basic functions like `exp`, `log`, etc, complying with these rules are provided in interval arithmetic libraries. We make use of the Julia library IntervalArithmetic https github.com JuliaIntervals IntervalArithmetic.jl in this tutorial, but there are many other interval arithmetic librairies, in different languages, like Arb https arblib.org or Intlab https www.tuhh.de ti3 rump intlab . \"\"\" c interval 2,4 d cos exp sqrt c Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"note\", \"Remarks\", md\"\"\" Remark. Even when doing computer assisted proofs, one should not use interval arithmetics for all computations. When trying to find an approximate solution \\bar x , floating point calculations are perfectly fine, and it is only when evaluating the bounds in the Newton Kantorovich theorem that interval arithmetic must be used. \"\"\" md\"\"\" References ^BL15 J.
