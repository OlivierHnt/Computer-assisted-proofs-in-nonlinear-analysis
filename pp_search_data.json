Step 2: Run Julia After installing,  make sure that you can run Julia . On some systems, this means searching for the Julia program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command  julia  in a terminal. Make sure that you are able to launch Julia before proceeding! Step 3: Install RadiiPolynomial Next we will install  RadiiPolynomial , the library for computer-assisted proofs that we will be using during the course. RadiiPolynomial is a Julia package designed for rigorous spectral methods. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot.\nThere you type a command, and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result. To install RadiiPolynomial, we want to run a  package manager command . To switch from  Julia  mode to  Pkg  mode, type  ]  (closing square bracket) at the  julia>  prompt: \njulia> ]\n\n(@v 1.10 ) pkg>\n The line turns blue and the prompt changes to  pkg> , telling you that you are now in  package manager mode . This mode allows you to do operations on  packages  (also called libraries). Then, run the following (case sensitive) command to  add  (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet (you should only need to do this  once  for each installation of Julia): \n(@v 1.10 ) pkg> add RadiiPolynomial\n You can now close the terminal. Step 4: Running RadiiPolynomial Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project. Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type: julia> using RadiiPolynomial\n \nconst run = f => f();\nrun(async () => {\nconst versions = await (await fetch(`https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json`)).json()\nconst sortby = v => v.split(\"-\")[0].split(\".\").map(parseFloat).reduce((a,b) => a*10000 + b)\nconst version_names = Object.keys(versions).sort((a,b) => sortby(a) - sortby(b)).reverse()\nconst stable = version_names.find(v => versions[v].stable)\nconsole.log({stable})\nconst pkg_stable = /\\d+\\.\\d+/.exec(stable)[0]\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"auto-julia-version\").forEach(el => {\n    console.log(el)\n    el.innerText = el.getAttribute(\"short\") == null ? stable : pkg_stable\n})\n});"},{"url":"logistics/","title":"Class logistics","tags":["welcome"],"text":"main a img {\n    width: 5rem;\n    margin: 1rem;\n}\n Course logistics"},{"url":"search/","title":"Search results","tags":[],"text":"window.init_search(); Search Results \nLoading..."},{"url":"assets/scripts/get_highlights/","title":"get_highlights","tags":[],"text":"if isempty get metadata \"homepage\" , \"highlights\", nothing else highlights htl \"\"\" section div class \"content\" h2 x \"name\" h2 p x \"text\" p div div class \"preview\" img src \" x \"img\" \" div section \"\"\" for x in metadata \"homepage\" \"highlights\" htl \"\"\" div class \"subjectscontainer wide\" h1 Highlights h1 div class \"contain\" highlights div div \"\"\" end"},{"url":"assets/scripts/get_subjects/","title":"get_subjects","tags":[],"text":"let sections metadata \"sidebar\" sections htl \"\"\" let input other page.input output other page.output name get output.frontmatter, \"title\", basename input.relative path desc get output.frontmatter, \"description\", nothing tags get output.frontmatter, \"tags\", String image get output.frontmatter, \"image\", nothing class \"no decoration\", \"tag replace x, \" \" \" \" \" for x in tags ..., image nothing || isempty image ? nothing htl \"\"\" a title desc class class href root url \" \" other page.url h3 name h3 img src image a \"\"\" end for other page in collections section id .pages \"\"\" for section id, section name in sections isempty sections ? nothing htl \"\"\" div class \"wide subjectscontainer\" h1 Subjects h1 div class \"subjects\" sections div div \"\"\" end"},{"url":"homework/hw1/","title":"Periodic orbits","tags":["module2","homeworks"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.25 frontmatter homework number \"1\" order \"2.5\" title \"Periodic orbits\" tags \"module2\", \"homeworks\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" description \"Proof of periodic orbits\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils using PlutoTeachingTools, PlutoUI md\"\"\" Sample Homework This notebook showcases some of the features of `PlutoTeachingTools.jl` https github.com JuliaPluto PlutoTeachingTools.jl and how to use these to write homework assignment in Pluto. \"\"\" tip md\"\"\"For a deeper tour of `PlutoTeachingTools.jl`, check their documentation https juliapluto.github.io PlutoTeachingTools.jl example.html \"\"\" md\"\"\" Useful functionalities `PlutoTeachingTools.jl` has some functions like `correct`, `still missing`, here a few demoes \"\"\" correct still missing keep working keep working md\"you can also give custom text to the boxes\" hint md\"this is a hint, hover the box to unblur the text\" md\"\"\" Exercise 1 a simple exercise Replace missing with the value `1`. \"\"\" x missing if ismissing x still missing elseif x 1 && x isa Int correct elseif x 1 && x isa Int b1 almost md\"\"\"Your variable has the right value, but it's not quite the right answer.
