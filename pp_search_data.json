The specific form of T may vary depending on the nature of the problem, but we can outline a general strategy for constructing such an operator. First, we provide sufficient conditions that can be verified in practice to demonstrate that an operator T is contracting on a small neighborhood of \\bar x . Although this first module focuses on finite dimentional problems, we state these conditions in the more general setting of a Banach space https en.wikipedia.org wiki Banach space , as they will play an important role in the next modules. \"\"\" md\"\"\" theorem \"Theorem Contraction mapping \" Let \\mathcal X be a Banach space, \\bar x \\in \\mathcal X , and T \\mathcal X \\to \\mathcal X a continuously differentiable map.

Therefore, one can fix a priori some R 0 , and weaken the assumption by only asking for Z to be defined on 0, R and to satisfy \\| DT x \\| \\le Z \\| x \\bar x \\| for all x \\in \\mathcal X such that \\| x \\bar x \\| \\le R . Of course, we are then only allowed to consider r \\in 0, R . In practice, studying carefully how \\| DT x \\| depends on \\| x \\bar x \\| helps us to get better bounds. However, we can sometimes get away with coarser estimates. Specifically, we derive a constant Z such that \\| DT x \\| \\le Z for all x \\in \\mathcal X such that \\| x \\bar x \\| \\le R , and then use Z s Z for all s \\in 0, R . The conditions on r then simplify, and, if Z 1 , we can take any r \\ge \\frac Y 1 Z . \"\"\" md\"\"\" For a dynamical system x n 1 f x n , a natural fixed point operator for period 3 orbits is given by T x \\overset \\text def f^3 x , which represents f composed with itself three times. However, in general such a T has no reason to be contracting. To develop a more general procedure for constructing a fixed point problem, one can start by finding a map F whose isolated zeros are solutions to our problem. For this example, we consider the mapping F \\mathbb R ^3 \\to \\mathbb R ^3 given by ```math F x 1, x 2, x 3 \\overset \\text def \\begin pmatrix f x 1 x 2 \\\\ f x 2 x 3 \\\\ f x 3 x 1 \\end pmatrix . ``` Given an approximate solution \\bar x , one can consider the Newton like operator T x \\overset \\text def x DF \\bar x ^ 1 F x . This operator should be contracting in a neighborhood of \\bar x , as DT \\bar x 0 . For finite dimensional problems of moderate size, computing the inverse of DF \\bar x is possible. However, in infinite dimensional problems, working with DF \\bar x ^ 1 can be challenging. To address this, we often consider an approximate inverse A \\approx DF \\bar x ^ 1 and define the fixed point operator T x \\overset \\text def x AF x . In the following results, we will operate under this framework, where A is not specified and could be DF \\bar x ^ 1 or another suitable approximation. \"\"\" md\"\"\" corollary \"Corollary Newton Kantorovich \" Let \\mathcal X and \\mathcal Y be two Banach spaces, \\bar x \\in \\mathcal X , F \\mathcal X \\to \\mathcal Y a continuously differentiable map, A \\mathcal Y \\to \\mathcal X am injective linear map, and R 0 .

Variations of this result can be found throughout the literature and are commonly used in computer assisted proofs CAPs see e.g. ^BL15 ^NPW19 and the references therein . \"\"\" md\" Interval arithmetic\" md\"\"\" When we want to apply the contraction mapping theorem with \\bar x as an approximate solution obtained using the computer, we also need to compute values for the bounds Y and Z . However, these calculations typically rely on floating point arithmetic, which introduces rounding errors. For instance, if we execute `Y norm A F x̄ , 1 ` on the computer, we cannot be certain that Y is an upper bound for \\|A F \\bar x \\| 1 . Interval arithmetic https en.wikipedia.org wiki Interval arithmetic provides a robust method to control rounding errors and ensuring guaranteed results from computer calculations. In this section, we offer a brief description of interval arithmetic for more detailed discussions, please refer to ^Moo79 and ^Tuc11 . \"\"\" md\" Overview\" md\"\"\" The central concept of interval arithmetic is to represent any real number by an interval, whose endpoints are floating point numbers. More precisely, for a \\in \\mathbb R , we define the interval \\underline a , \\overline a where \\underline a , \\overline a are floating point numbers satisfying \\underline a \\le a \\le \\overline a . While we give up the hope of representing numbers exactly, we recover guaranteed information the real number a is contained within the interval stored in the computer. The rules of interval arithmetic ensure that this containment property is preserved for arithmetic operations. For instance, consider two intervals a and b of the form \\underline a , \\overline a and \\underline b , \\overline b , which enclose the reals numbers a and b respectively. When we perform the operation c a b , the resulting interval c \\underline c , \\overline c is computed as follows for \\underline c , we take \\underline a \\underline b rounded downward , and for \\overline c , we take \\overline a \\overline b rounded upward . In particular, the real number c a b is contained within the interval c . Similarly, if c is an interval \\underline c , \\overline c and we compute d e^ c , the resulting interval d contains e^c . In this course, we use the Julia library IntervalArithmetic https github.com JuliaIntervals IntervalArithmetic.jl , though many other interval arithmetic libraries are available in different programming languages. Note that IntervalArithmetic is automatically included when using RadiiPolynomial https github.com OlivierHnt RadiiPolynomial.jl .

Since 1 10 cannot be represented exactly in base 2, the value stored in `x` is not precisely equal to the typed in number `0.1`. In fact, it turns out to be slightly larger than 1 10 , but it could just as easily have been smaller as seen with `x 0.3` .

If \\nu is chosen too large, the computer assisted proof CAP will fail. The first step is to discretize this space as a sequence space. However, if the radius of convergence of the function lies in the interval 0, 1 , the coefficients of the series grow, which leads to numerical instability. To mitigate this, it is good practice to re scale the problem so that the radius of convergence is at least 1 , and we may as well scale it to 1 . We rescale the time variable by introducing ```math w s u \\nu s , \\qquad \\text for all s \\in 1, 1 . ``` Then, the sequence space we use is ```math \\ell^1 \\mathbb N \\overset \\text def \\left\\ x \\in \\mathbb R ^\\mathbb N \\, \\, \\| x \\| 1 \\overset \\text def \\sum n \\ge 0 |x n| \\infty \\right\\ . ``` The properties of this space were discussed in Module 2.

To formalize this, we define the projection operator \\Pi N \\ell^1 \\mathbb N \\to \\ell^1 \\mathbb N which extracts the first N 1 coefficients of a sequence. Specifically, for all x \\in \\ell^1 \\mathbb N , we have ```math \\Pi N x n \\overset \\text def \\begin cases x n, & n \\le N, \\\\ 0, & n N. \\end cases ``` The complementary projection, which removes the first N 1 modes, is defined as \\Pi N \\overset \\text def I \\Pi N , where I is the identity operator. \"\"\" md\" Zero finding problem\" md\"\"\" Substituting w t \\sum n \\ge 0 x n t^n into the ODE, with initial condition w 0 \\phi , leads to the recurrence relation ```math x 0 \\phi, \\qquad x n \\frac \\nu n x n 1 x x n 1 , \\quad n \\ge 1. ``` We can re write this set of equations more concisely as ```math x \\phi \\nu \\Lambda x x x , ``` where ```math \\Lambda x \\overset \\text def \\begin cases 0, & n 0, \\\\ \\displaystyle \\frac 1 n x n 1 , & n \\ge 1. \\end cases ``` We slightly abuse notation and identify \\phi with its sequence of Taylor coefficients \\phi, 0, \\dots \\in \\ell^1 \\mathbb N .

Using interval arithmetic, it’s possible to compute the Taylor coefficients \\tilde x 0, \\dots, \\tilde x N exactly, up to any desired order N 0 . Once we have these, we can define the truncated sequence \\hat x \\tilde x 0, \\dots, \\tilde x N, 0, \\dots , where the terms beyond N are set to zero. To estimate the truncation error, observe that the recurrence relation naturally leads to a fixed point operator T .

The setting is again infinite dimensional, with some small differences We use Fourier series rather than Taylor series. The Fourier coefficients are two sided sequences of complex numbers. The convolution product is given by an infinite series. The problem of finding a closed orbit is global in the sense that there is no equivalent of \"short time\" integration. \"\"\" md\" Motivating example a forced, damped, nonlinear pendulum\" md\"\"\" Consider the second order ODE ```math u'' t \\beta 1 u' t \\beta 2 u t u t ^2 \\beta 3 \\cos t , ``` where \\beta 1, \\beta 2, \\beta 3 are parameters.

Derive computable formulas for the bounds Y, Z 1, Z 2 , and verify the radii polynomial inequalities. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Why is this a \"simple\" example? A more natural problem to look at is to find a periodic orbit in a system of ODEs. In such an autonomous system of ODEs the period of a periodic solution is unknown a priori, and determining the period \\tau is thus part of the problem, in addition to finding the unknown \\tau periodic function u t . Furthermore, when u t is a periodic solution, so is u t t 0 for any time shift t 0 . In particular, periodic solutions are not isolated unless an additional phase condition is imposed. A final complication is that for a system of equations the bookkeeping is more involved than for a single equation. Although these difficulties can be overcome, the notation can get in the way of understanding. Since we want to focus here on how to deal with periodic functions, we choose to look at a scalar, non autonomous problem where the period is given. \"\"\" md\" Sequence space\" md\"\"\" The space we are interested in is the space of periodic analytic functions.
