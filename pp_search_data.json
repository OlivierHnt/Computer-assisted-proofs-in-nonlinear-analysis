The specific form of T may vary depending on the nature of the problem, but we can outline a general strategy for constructing such an operator. We provide sufficient conditions that can be verified in practice to demonstrate that an operator T is contracting on a small neighborhood of \\bar x .

Of course, we are then only allowed to consider r \\in 0,r . In practice, studying carefully how \\Vert DT x \\Vert depends on \\Vert x \\bar x \\Vert allows us to get better bounds.

However, such a T has no reason to be contracting. To develop a more general procedure for constructing a fixed point problem, one can start by finding a map F whose isolated zeros are solutions to our problem. Given an approximate solution \\bar x , one can consider the Newton like operator T x x DF \\bar x ^ 1 F x . This operator should be contracting in a neighborhood of \\bar x , as DT \\bar x 0 . For finite dimensional problems of moderate size, computing the inverse of DF \\bar x is feasible. However, in infinite dimensional problems, DF \\bar x ^ 1 may become challenging to work with. To address this, one often considers an approximate inverse A \\approx DF \\bar x ^ 1 and the fixed point operator T x x AF x . We state all following results in this context, for an A which is not specified and could actually but does not have to be DF \\bar x ^ 1 . \"\"\" Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"tip\", \"Corollary\", md\"\"\" Let \\mathcal X and \\mathcal Y be two Banach spaces, \\bar x \\in \\mathcal X , F \\mathcal X \\to \\mathcal Y a continuously differentiable map, A \\mathcal Y \\to \\mathcal X an injective linear map, and r 0 .

Many slight variations can be found in the literature, and are used in many CAPs see for instance ^BL15 ^NPW19 and the references therein . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Interval arithmetic \"\"\" md\"\"\" When we want to use the Newton Kantorovich theorem with \\bar x being an approximate solution obtained using the computer, we also need to use the computer to evaluate quantities like \\Vert F \\bar x \\Vert to obtain the bounds Y and Z . However, by default these computations are performed using floating point arithmetic, which introduces rounding errors. In particular, if we set Y \\Vert F \\bar x \\Vert on the computer, we cannot be certain that Y actually satifies the assumption of the Newton Kantorovich theorem. Interval arithmetic https en.wikipedia.org wiki Interval arithmetic provides a way to control rounding errors and obtain guaranteed results from computer calculations. Here, we only give a brief description of interval arithmetic refer to ^Moo79 ^Tuc11 for more detailed discussions. \"\"\" md\"\"\" When a command like `a 0.1` is executed in Julia, the computer associates to the variable `a` a single floating point number the floating point number which is the closest to 1 10 . Since 1 10 does not have a finite representation in base 2 , the value stored in `a` is already not equal to the typed in number `0.1`. It turns out to be slightly larger than 1 10 , but it could very well have been the other way around e.g. `0.3` . \"\"\" a 0.1 a 1 10 md\"\"\" When using interval arithmetic, we represent any real number by an interval, whose end points are floating point numbers. More precisely, for a \\in \\mathbb R , we consider the interval \\underline a , \\overline a where \\underline a , \\overline a are floating point numbers satisfying \\underline a \\le a \\le \\overline a . We give up the hope of representing numbers exactly, but we recover guaranteed information the real number a is contained in the interval representing it on the computer. We use the Julia package IntervalArithmetic.jl https github.com JuliaIntervals IntervalArithmetic.jl in this course, but there are many other interval arithmetic librairies in different languages e.g. Arb https arblib.org or Intlab https www.tuhh.de ti3 rump intlab . Note that IntervalArithmetic is automatically available when using RadiiPolynomial.jl https github.com OlivierHnt RadiiPolynomial.jl . \"\"\" ia I\"0.1\" interval 1 interval 10 in interval 1 10, ia md\"\"\" The rules of interval arithmetic then ensure that this property is preserved when doing arithmetic operations. For instance, consider two intervals `a` and `b` of the form \\underline a , \\overline a and \\underline b , \\overline b , containing the reals numbers a and b . When we do `c a b`, the resulting interval \\underline c ,\\overline c for `c` is computed as follows. For \\underline c , we take \\underline a \\underline b rounded downward , and for \\overline c we take \\overline a \\overline b rounded upward . In particular, the real number c a b is contained in the interval `c`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Similarly, if the variable `c` is an interval \\underline c , \\overline c , and we compute `d exp c `, we would like that `d` contains \\exp c . Usual arithmetic operations, as well as implementations of elementary functions e.g. `exp`, `log`, `cos`, etc. complying with these rules are provided in IntervalArithmetic. \"\"\" c interval 2, 4 d cos exp sqrt c Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"note\", \"Remarks\", md\"\"\" Even when doing computer assisted proofs, one should not use interval arithmetics for all computations. When trying to find an approximate solution \\bar x , floating point calculations are perfectly fine, and it is only when evaluating the bounds in the Newton Kantorovich theorem that interval arithmetic must be used. \"\"\" md\"\"\" References ^BL15 J.

Furthermore, when u t is a periodic solution, so is u t t 0 for any time shift t 0 . In particular, periodic solutions are not isolated unless an additional phase condition is imposed. A final complication is that for a system of equations the bookkeeping is more involved than for a single equation.
