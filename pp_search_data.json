RadiiPolynomial is a Julia package designed for computer-assisted proofs relying on spectral methods and the contraction mapping theorem. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia: there you type a command, and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result.

Our goal will be to prove the existence of a period 3 orbit, by first finding numerically an approximate period 3 orbit, and then proving a posteriori the existence of a true period 3 orbit nearby. There are several ways to prove the existence of a period 3 orbit for this example with and without computer assistance , but the ideas we are going to present and use will generalize to more complicated infinite dimensional problems. \"\"\" md\" Contraction mapping and the Newton Kantorovich theorem\" md\"\"\" Given a problem and an approximate solution \\bar x , our goal is to define a fixed point operator T such that the solutions to our problem are in one to one correspondence with fixed points of T , T is a contraction on a small neighborhood of \\bar x . The specific form of T may vary depending on the nature of the problem, but we can outline a general strategy for constructing such an operator. We provide sufficient conditions that can be verified in practice to demonstrate that an operator T is contracting on a small neighborhood of \\bar x . Even though we only deal with finite dimentional problems in this first module, we already state these conditions in a general Banach space https en.wikipedia.org wiki Banach space , as they will also be heavily used in the next modules. \"\"\" md\"\"\" theorem \"Theorem Contraction mapping \" Let \\mathcal X be a Banach space, \\bar x \\in \\mathcal X , and T \\mathcal X \\to \\mathcal X a continuously differentiable map.

Of course, we are then only allowed to consider r \\in 0, r . In practice, studying carefully how \\| DT x \\| depends on \\| x \\bar x \\| allows us to get better bounds. However, we can sometimes get away with cruder estimates. That is, we derive a constant Z such that \\| DT x \\| \\le Z for all x \\in \\mathcal X such that \\| x \\bar x \\| \\le r , and then use Z s Z for all s \\le r .

However, such a T has no reason to be contracting. To develop a more general procedure for constructing a fixed point problem, one can start by finding a map F whose isolated zeros are solutions to our problem. Given an approximate solution \\bar x , one can consider the Newton like operator T x x DF \\bar x ^ 1 F x . This operator should be contracting in a neighborhood of \\bar x , as DT \\bar x 0 . For finite dimensional problems of moderate size, computing the inverse of DF \\bar x is feasible. However, in infinite dimensional problems, DF \\bar x ^ 1 may become challenging to work with. To address this, one often considers an approximate inverse A \\approx DF \\bar x ^ 1 and the fixed point operator T x x AF x . We state all following results in this context, for an A which is not specified and could actually but does not have to be DF \\bar x ^ 1 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" corollary \"Corollary Newton Kantorovich \" Let \\mathcal X and \\mathcal Y be two Banach spaces, \\bar x \\in \\mathcal X , F \\mathcal X \\to \\mathcal Y a continuously differentiable map, A \\mathcal Y \\to \\mathcal X an injective linear map, and r 0 .

Many slight variations of this result appear throughout the literature and are frequently applied in CAPs see for instance ^BL15 ^NPW19 and the references therein . \"\"\" md\" Interval arithmetic\" md\"\"\" When we want to use the contraction mapping theorem with \\bar x being an approximate solution obtained using the computer, we also need to use the computer to evaluate quantities to obtain the bounds Y and Z . However, these computations typically rely on floating point arithmetic, which introduces rounding errors. In particular, if we set Y \\| T \\bar x \\bar x \\| on the computer, we cannot be certain that Y actually satifies the assumption of the Newton Kantorovich theorem. Interval arithmetic https en.wikipedia.org wiki Interval arithmetic provides a way to control rounding errors and obtain guaranteed results from computer calculations. Here, we only give a brief description of interval arithmetic refer to ^Moo79 ^Tuc11 for more detailed discussions. \"\"\" md\" Overview\" md\"\"\" When using interval arithmetic, we represent any real number by an interval, whose end points are floating point numbers. More precisely, for a \\in \\mathbb R , we consider the interval \\underline a , \\overline a where \\underline a , \\overline a are floating point numbers satisfying \\underline a \\le a \\le \\overline a . We give up the hope of representing numbers exactly, but we recover guaranteed information the real number a is contained in the interval stored in the computer. The rules of interval arithmetic then ensure that this property is preserved when doing arithmetic operations. For instance, consider two intervals `a` and `b` of the form \\underline a , \\overline a and \\underline b , \\overline b , containing the reals numbers a and b , respectively. When we perform c a b`, the resulting interval \\underline c ,\\overline c for `c` is computed as follows. For \\underline c , we take \\underline a \\underline b rounded downward , and for \\overline c we take \\overline a \\overline b rounded upward . In particular, the real number c a b is contained in the interval `c`. Similarly, if the variable `c` is an interval \\underline c , \\overline c , and we compute `d exp c `, we have that `d` contains \\exp c . We use the Julia library IntervalArithmetic https github.com JuliaIntervals IntervalArithmetic.jl in this course, but there are many other interval arithmetic librairies in different languages e.g. Intlab https www.tuhh.de ti3 rump intlab for Matlab . Note that IntervalArithmetic is automatically available when using RadiiPolynomial https github.com OlivierHnt RadiiPolynomial.jl . Usual arithmetic operations, as well as implementations of elementary functions e.g. `exp`, `log`, `cos`, etc. complying with these rules are provided in IntervalArithmetic. \"\"\" a interval 2, 4 cos exp sqrt a md\"\"\" note \"Remarks\" Even when doing computer assisted proofs, one should not use interval arithmetics for every computations. Typically, when trying to find an approximate solution \\bar x , floating point calculations are perfectly fine, and it is only when evaluating the bounds in the Newton Kantorovich theorem that interval arithmetic must be used. \"\"\" md\" Beware of typed in floating point numbers\" md\"\"\" When a command like `x 0.1` is executed in Julia, the computer associates to the variable `x` a floating point number the floating point number which is the closest to 1 10 . Since 1 10 does not have a finite representation in base 2 , the value stored in `x` is already not equal to the typed in number `0.1`. It turns out to be slightly larger than 1 10 , but it could very well have been the other way around see what happens for `x 0.3` .

In such an autonomous system of ODEs the period of a periodic solution is unknown a priori, and determining the period \\tau is thus part of the problem, in addition to finding the unknown \\tau periodic function u t . Furthermore, when u t is a periodic solution, so is u t t 0 for any time shift t 0 . In particular, periodic solutions are not isolated unless an additional phase condition is imposed. A final complication is that for a system of equations the bookkeeping is more involved than for a single equation. Although these difficulties can be overcome, the notation can get in the way of understanding. Since we want to focus here on how to deal with periodic functions, we choose to look at a scalar, non autonomous problem where the period is given. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Fourier series We substitute the Fourier series ```math u t \\sum k \\in \\mathbb Z a k e^ i k t , ``` in the ODE to find the infinite set of equations ```math \\lambda k a k a a k c k 0, \\qquad k \\in \\mathbb Z , ``` where ```math \\lambda k \\overset \\text def k^2 i \\beta 1 k \\beta 2 ``` and c represents the Fourier transform of \\beta 3 \\cos t , given by ```math c k \\overset \\text def \\begin cases \\frac \\beta 3 2 , & k \\pm 1, \\\\ 0, & k \\ne \\pm 1. \\end cases ``` Convolution The convolution product is given by ```math a b k \\overset \\text def \\sum l \\in \\mathbb Z a k l b l, \\qquad k \\in \\mathbb Z . ``` \"\"\" Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition \"tip\", \"Lemma\", md\"\"\"If u t \\sum k \\in \\mathbb Z a k e^ i k t and v t \\sum k \\in \\mathbb Z b k e^ i k t , then for their product we have u t v t \\sum k \\in \\mathbb Z a b k e^ i k t .\"\"\" md\"\"\" In particular, whenever a k 0 for |k| K a and b k 0 for |k| K b the convolution can be computed.
